Hi, my name is Lorenzo and I’m a Security Consultant, hacking and securing any kind of stuff is my passion!

Web Application security, Wireless Network Assessment and Mobile Applications are my main areas of focus but I am also fascinated by the IoT World and by the physical aspect of information security.

After work I like challenging for a bug bounty and trying to find out some interesting vulnerabilities to [disclose][disc]. 

When I’m not in front of a screen, I attend some security conferences around Italy both as speaker or attendee.   

In my career I have managed to achive some important milestones such as: 
- [ISECOM OSSTMM][isecom] 3.0 Professional Security Tester (A17964)
- Master degree in Information Security from [Università degli Studi di Milano][uni]

You read all the way to here? Incredible! Then maybe you are also interested in checking out my [Blog][blog], or maybe even following me on [Twitter][twitter].
